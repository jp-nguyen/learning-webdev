        Notes from Lesson 20: Basic tags
   </h1> 

   <p> 
       Here are the heading tags which you can invoke by doing
       <i>&lt;h#&gt;</i>, where the # is the "level of importance" that you 
       want for the content. Note that these are block-level elements.
   </p>

   <h1> This is heading 1! </h1>
   <h2> This is heading 2! </h2>
   <h3> This is heading 3! </h3>
   <h4> This is heading 4! </h4>
   <h5> This is heading 5! </h5>
   <h6> This is heading 6! </h6>

   <p>
       There are also in-line tags that don't take up a new line. These include 
       <i>italicizing</i> text and <b>bolding</b> text (though in HTML5,
       semantic markup  with HTML5 is recommended). For contrast, here is 
       <em>italicizing</em> with em and <strong>bolding</strong> with strong.
