    <h1>Notes from Lesson 25: HTML Attributes</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Attributes</strong> are a way to add additional information to 
        a tag. They come in a <em>key-value</em>pair in tags, usually formatted
        as a ``attribute = string value''. We will cover only some attributes.
    </p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
        These tags usually don't have much stuff. They have an attribute called
        <em>src</em> that is equal to the url of the image. This can be from 
        another host or part of the machine. The <strong>img</strong> tag is 
        a self-closing tag. For instance, this picture of Kirby:
        <p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Kirby.png">
        </p>
        is done with the following text:
        <p> 
            <code>
                &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Kirby.png"&gt;
            </code>
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>a</strong> tag (which means anchor) has the attribute 
        <em>href</em> which is set to the url. For instance,
        <a href="https://google.com">here</a> is a link to Google.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the link is using the HTTP protocol. By default, the link goes
        to the file protocol. An example would be going to
        <a href="24-divs-and-spans.html">here</a> for the previous notes.
