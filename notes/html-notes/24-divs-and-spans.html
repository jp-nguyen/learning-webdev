    <h1>Notes from Lesson 24: Divs and Spans</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>divs</strong> and <strong>spans</strong> are HTML tags that are
        not as useful until we get into CSS styling.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <strong>div</strong> is a generic container for content. This 
        basically allows you to group things together in HTML. For instance, if 
        you want to group a heading and paragraph together, you can use a div 
        tag to do so and add some styling to the background.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <strong>span</strong> is also a generic container for content, but
        there is a key difference: the level of the tags. While a div is a
        <em>block-level</em> tag, a span is an <em>inline-level</em> tag.
