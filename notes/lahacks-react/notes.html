   <p> 
       This requires Node.js (which is a <em>thing</em> that I don't know 
       about). We'll see how this goes. Here is a 
       <a href="https://tinyurl.com/hackreact">link</a> to the slides.
   </p>

   <p>
       <strong>React</strong> is a framework that allows the creation of
       your own "html" tags. These are called <em>components</em>, which
       are usable.
   </p>

   <p>
       Before we dive in, know what a <strong>class</strong> is in
       Javascript. You can read about it in their README on their
       <a href="https://github.com/uclaacm/la-hacks-19-react-workshop">github</a>. 
       Their README is actually very detailed as well, so make sure you give it 
       a read!
   </p>

   <p>
        To start, you want to type in the following command,
        <code>npx create-react-app [directory]</code> which will do all the 
        setup for you to make a React app. 
   </p>

   <p>
       From here, you then type <code>npm start</code> to essentially run
       the app that is built.
   </p>

   <p>
       <strong>Props</strong> are attributes passed in from the parent
       component to the child component, similar to <em>inherited</em>
       attributes.
   </p>

   <p>
       The <strong>map</strong> function allows to "map" each part of a list
       to a particular object or other thing.
   </p>

   <p>
       <strong>States</strong> are what you'd expect honestly.
