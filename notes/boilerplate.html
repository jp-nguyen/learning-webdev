        Notes from Lesson 19: HTML Boilerplate and Comments
    </h1> 

    <p>
        You can set up the HTML boilerplate in VS Code by first typing in "html" 
        on the file, then tabbing the second option to create the whole 
        template! That's some litty-spaghitty stuff.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Having a <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> means you are <i>declaring</i> the
        file as an HTML file.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> element provides general information about the
        document, including title and links to scripts and style sheets. 
        Everything unseen usually goes in here.
    </p>

    <p>
        In contrast, the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> element provides the content of the
        document, i.e. everything that is seen.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can toggle commands in VS Code by typing in Command+Slash (&#8984;/)
        on the line that you want to comment out. Comments usually look 
        something like this: <i>&lt;!-- This is a comment! --&gt;</i>.
