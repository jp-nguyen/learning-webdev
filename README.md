# learning-webdev
This is here to hold all the information I'm learning about web development.

## Goals
- learn HTML and CSS (and **not forget it**)
- learn Javascript, Node, Express, all that jazz
- learn how to use git for personal projects
    - this includes formatting with Git Markdown
    - also more consistent style for commits and whatnot
- learn VS Code (I'm still using Terminal right now)
    - extensions

## Personal Log

### July 13, 2019
Did a lot more now. Almost done with HTML (may finish if I don't keep getting distracted).
- wrote notes on tables, forms, and inputs

### July 7, 2019
LOL my bad again. Back in the summer working on this while doing system design too. Here's what I accomplished today:
- wrote notes on lists, divs and spans, and attributes
- organized notes about html in one folder
- renamed notes to indicate which section I was on

### March 26, 2019
Whoops, my bad. Finally got around to continuing the bootcamp. Here's what I 
accomplished today:
- wrote more notes on boilerplate code and tags from the bootcamp
- learned some shortcuts in VS code for faster HTML coding and efficiency
- maintaining a new style rule for myself of 80 characters per line for readability (besides in README.md)

### February 26, 2019
I spent some good time actually reading up on HTML. Haven't continued the bootcamp yet,
but I will probably soon. 

This is what I accomplished:
- learned how to do unordered and ordered lists on HTML
- learned how to anchor hyperlinks (and work with attributes)
- filled out the body of getting-started.html

### February 25, 2019
I will be learning everything from udemy's The Web Developer Bootcamp, which is taught by
Colt Steele.

I accomplished a lot today:
- got the git repo set up
- got VS Code set up
- installed Vim (lol) on VS Code
