# learning-webdev
This is here to hold all the information I'm learning about web development.

## Goals
- learn HTML and CSS (and **not forget it**)
- learn Javascript, Node, Express, all that jazz
- learn how to use git for personal projects
    - this includes formatting with Git Markdown
    - also more consistent style for commits and whatnot
- learn VS Code (I'm still using Terminal right now)
    - extensions

## Personal Log
### February 26, 2019
I spent some good time actually reading up on HTML. Haven't continued the bootcamp yet,
but I will probably soon. 

This is what I accomplished:
- learned how to do unordered and ordered lists on HTML
- learned how to anchor hyperlinks (and work with attributes)
- filled out the body of getting-started.html

### February 25, 2019
I will be learning everything from udemy's The Web Developer Bootcamp, which is taught by
Colt Steele.

I accomplished a lot today:
- got the git repo set up
- got VS Code set up
- installed Vim (lol) on VS Code
