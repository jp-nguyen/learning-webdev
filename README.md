# learning-webdev
This is here to hold all the information I'm learning about web development.

## Goals
- learn HTML and CSS (and **not forget it**)
- learn how to use git for personal projects
- learn VS Code (I'm still using Terminal right now)

## Personal Log
### February 25, 2019
I will be learning everything from udemy's The Web Developer Bootcamp, which is taught by
Colt Steele.

In addition, I will also be working out how to use GitHub well.
