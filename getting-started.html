            HTML is a <strong>markup</strong> used to tell the browser how to structure web pages you visit.
        </h1>

        <p>
            In general, everything in HTML is an element, enclosed with an opening tag and a closing tag 
            (both of which usually have <strong>angle brackets</strong>). Some may not have the closing tag 
            though, for example img.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two types of elements:
            <ol>
                <li>block-level: appearing on a new line</li>
                <li>inline-level: appearing on the same line</li>
            </ol>

            These are important categories to know!
        </p>

        <p>
            Elements can also have attributes, which add more information that you don't want to show in the 
            content. An attribute has the following:
            <ul>
                <li> a space between it and the element name/previous attribute</li>
                <li> the attribute name followed by equals </li>
                <li> the attribute value </li>
            </ul>
            
            For instance, this hyperlink to 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOOhPfMbuIQ" title="still feel"
            target="_blank">a great music video</a> 
            has three attributes!
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: Some attributes may not have values (they act as booleans). In addition, try to always quote
            the attribute values. It's just better practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are some characters that need escaping to be shown. For instance, &lt; and &gt; are literally typed as
            &amp;lt and &amp;gt, respectively.

            These are notes that I took from the helpful MDN web docs, which you can look at
